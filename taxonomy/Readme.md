# AI Risk Taxonomy

This section defines a structured taxonomy of AI risks.

The taxonomy will be expanded incrementally and is designed to support:
- Risk identification
- Control mapping
- Regulatory alignment
- Audit and assurance activities

Initial focus will be on security-related AI risks, starting with:
- LLM prompt injection
- Indirect prompt injection via documents and retrieval
- Instruction override and role hijacking
- Data exfiltration through LLM outputs

Additional AI risk domains (governance, model risk, bias, lifecycle, third-party risk)
will be added incrementally in future iterations.
